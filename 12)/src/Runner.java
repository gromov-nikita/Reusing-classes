Exercise 9: (2) Create a class called Root that contains an instance of each of the classes
(that you also create) named Component1, Component2, and Component3. Derive a
class Stem from Root that also contains an instance of each “component.” All classes should
have default constructors that print a message about that class.

Exercise 12: (3) Add a proper hierarchy of dispose( ) methods to all the classes in
Exercise 9.
